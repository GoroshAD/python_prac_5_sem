Dynamic ratio load balancing is great for application traffic that can vary greatly from user to user. For example, a 
user for a payroll application might generate reports for 100 employees made up of big bulky PDFs, vs a user who is 
just logging in to make a change to her account. If you based your traffic distribution decisions on a static load 
balancing method, or even one of the simpler dynamic methods like least connections, you wouldn’t have a good way of 
knowing one server is working 500% harder than the other pool members and is subsequently slower – unless you have a 
way to measure server performance – let me introduce you to dynamic ratio load balancing…
super...
In order to use this load balancing method you will need to apply a performance monitor at the node level to the 
members in the pool and ensure the server supports that data collection. Other than the SNMP performance monitor, 
performance monitors require their specific plug-in file to be installed on the actual server.
